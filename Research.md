* ##  [Inferring Spatial Organizations of Chromosomes via Piecewise Helical Curve Models from Hi-C data](https://rsquared1427.github.io/phm/) 
June 2015 - August 2016 at Purdue University
  * Understand the 3D spatial organizations of chromosomes and functional implications of such structure.
  * Propose new, parsimonious, easy to interpret models for reconstructing 3D chromosomal structure from Hi-C data to fully characterize the 3D chromosomal structure and its structural variations.
  * Apply the method to high resolution Hi-C dataset generated from mouse embryonic stem cells.


* ## [Nonlinear partial differential equation, Harmonic analysis, Banach function spaces](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-015-9400-7)
September 2010 – June 2013 at Peking University
  * Considered the initial value problem for the hyperbolic type Davey-Stewartson equations, including elliptic-hyperbolic and hyperbolichyperbolic cases. 
  * Showed the local existence and uniqueness of the solution in the generalized Feichtinger algebra $M^s_{(1,1)}$ $(s\geq 3/2)$ with sufficiently small initial data in $M^{3/2}_{1,1}(R^2)$. 
  * Moreover, showed the ill-posedness of the solutions in the sense that the solution map is not C3 if the spatial regularity is below $M^{3/2}_{1,1}$.
