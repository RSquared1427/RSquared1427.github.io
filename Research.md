* ## Â [Inferring Spatial Organizations of Chromosomes via Piecewise Helical Curve Models from Hi-C data](https://rsquared1427.github.io/phm/) 
June 2015 - August 2016 at Purdue University
  * Understand the 3D spatial organizations of chromosomes and functional implications of such structure.
  * Propose new, parsimonious, easy to interpret models for reconstructing 3D chromosomal structure from Hi-C data to fully characterize the 3D chromosomal structure and its structural variations.
  * Apply the method to high resolution Hi-C dataset generated from mouse embryonic stem cells.
