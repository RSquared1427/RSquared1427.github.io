* ##  Inferring Spatial Organizations of Chromosomes via Piecewise Helical Curve Models from Hi-C data
- Understand the 3D spatial organizations of chromosomes and functional implications of such structure.
- Develop and apply statistical and computational methods in analyzing Hi-C data.
- Propose new parsimonious, easy to interpret models for reconstructing 3D chromosomal structure from Hi-C data to fully characterize the 3D chromosomal structure and its structural variations.
- Apply the method to high resolution Hi-C dataset generated from mouse embryonic stem cells.
